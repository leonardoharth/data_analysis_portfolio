## Data Analysis using R

### Crime incidence near schools in Philadelphia research

<img src="images/wise.jpg?raw=true"/>

This is part of my work as a research fellow at the Wharton Social Impact Initiative - [WSII](https://socialimpact.wharton.upenn.edu/ "WSII"). I was part of the Urban Analytics team led by [Dr. Shane Jensen](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/stjensen/ "Shane"), investigating the spatial correlation of schools and crime incidence in Philadelphia. I aggregated all crime, demographic, and environmental variables at the Census Block level. This research involved running a set of 32 linear regressions that combined different school levels, crime types, and time frames. I conducted a propensity score matching analysis to reiterate the results.

### Flood Risk Modeling in Calgary, Alberta

<img src="images/flood_calgary.png?raw=true"/>

This project was done with [Eugene Chong](https://e-chong.github.io/ "Eugene") for the Land Use and Environmental Modeling course at the University of Pennsylvania. We used data from the 2013 Alberta's Flood to build a logistic model to predict the likelihood of flood for each fishnet cell in Calgary.

In this project, [Jane Christen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jane-christen-b62a5653/ "Jane") and I modeled the demand for different services offered by Seattle's Aging and Disability Service. We built a set of four logistic regressions to understand the likelihood of elder citizens needing services in the future based on demographics and survey information from previous service users.

## Data Analysis using Python

### Water Risk Classification

<img src="images/water_stress.JPG?raw=true"/>

This project was done with [John Michael Lasalle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmichaellasalle/ "John Michael") for the [Geospatial Data Analysis in Python](https://github.com/MUSA-620-fall-2019 "MUSA 620") course at the University of Pennsylvania. We combined [Aqueduct Global Maps 3.0 Data](https://www.wri.org/resources/data-sets/aqueduct-global-maps-30-data "Aqueduct Maps") with child mortality rates, nightime light emissions, and population density data to create a cluster analysis of water stress arround the world.

### Seattle Buildings Energy Benchmarking Data Visualization

<img src="images/seattle_dv.png?raw=true"/>

This project is an assignment for the [Geospatial Data Analysis in Python](https://github.com/MUSA-620-fall-2019 "MUSA 620") course at the University of Pennsylvania. I was interested in exploring different Data Visualization libraries for Python, such as Seaborn, Altair, and Matplotlib.

## Web Apps using Javascript, HTML, and CSS

### Volcano Explorer

This is my term project for the course [Introduction to Web Mapping](https://github.com/MUSA611-CPLN692-spring2020/ "CPLN 692") at the University of Pennsylvania. I used data from the National Museum of Natural History to create a web application to visualize the Museumâ€™s volcanoes catalog.

### Seattle Buildings Energy Benchmark Slideshow

This is a Midterm for the course [Introduction to Web Mapping](https://github.com/MUSA611-CPLN692-spring2020/ "CPLN 692") at the University of Pennsylvania. I tested some filtering and styling options, using the Seattle 2018 Building Energy Benchmarking dataset.

## Data Analysis in ArcGIS

### ArcPy Lightplanner

This is a customized ArcGIS Toolbox that I creating using my experience as a lighting planner. The idea is to streamline a process of feasibility assessment for a LED upgrade plan.

## Arduino Coding

### Train Platform Optimization Platty++

This is a smart city project done for the [Sensing the City](http://www.sensingthecity.com/ "Sensing") course at the University of Pennsylvania. I worked with [Neil Narayan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-reid-narayan/ "Neil") and [Chin Yee Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chin-yee-lee-65383a165/ "Chin") to create a prototype for a smart boarding system for SEPTA using sensors.
